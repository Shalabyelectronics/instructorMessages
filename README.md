# complaint Messages to instructor version 0.1
This mini-project will focus on a common problem most online students could face, and it is writing a complaint request to the Instructor.
First, it sounds easy, but it is a massive issue for some students because they couldn't arrange their thoughts to determine their problem.
That is why this project came to solve this problem by generating a specific complaint message to your Instructor.
The main idea of this project is about collecting the primary information from the student then generating a ready message that is a copy-paste only.
