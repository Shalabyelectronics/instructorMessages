# complaint Messages to instructor version 0.1
### Introduction:
This mini-project will focus on a common problem most online students could face, and it is writing a complaint request to the Instructor.
First, it sounds easy, but it is a massive issue for some students because they couldn't arrange their thoughts to determine their problem.
That is why this project came to solve this problem by generating a specific complaint message to your Instructor.
The main idea of this project is about collecting the primary information from the student then generating a ready message that is a copy-paste only.
### How it's work?
When the code run it will ask the student three types of questions:
* Student details (Group number, First and last name)
* Course details (Course name, unit, and type of assignment section)
* Issue details (unfairly graded, Offensive comment, others)

#### After collecting all this information from the student, the output will be something like this:

Example:
```
Hello instructor [instructor_name],

My [type of assignment section] for unit [unit number] was [Issue details].
I kindly request you check this case out.

Best regards.
[student  First and last nam]
Group number : [group number]
```
#### This is a simple example provide how the output will look like.
The output file will be a text file type, and it will be located in the student desktop folder.
